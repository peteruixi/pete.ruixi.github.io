<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>One of the books I been reading imensely is: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio">‚ÄúGrokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other‚Äù</a> by Aditya Y. Bhargava. As if the title of the book isn‚Äôt telling, the book used loads of hand-drawn images to explain concepts and practition of algoritms. It definately gives reader the illusion of reading a fun comic book at times. The book essentially covers all the basics one need to know to get started with data structures and algorithms. Becasue of it‚Äôs illustrative nature, I would say it is a great reading material for people with zero computer programming background.</p>

<p>The reason why I chose this book to read in the first time, I will admit, I felt discourage to read thousands of pages of cuda programming even though its more elevant to my feild of interest. I am actually unregretfful to say thanks for my tardiness, I was able to read such an inspiring book. This book is all that I wished to have when I was studying data structure and algorithms, the most difficult part for me was trying to draw it out. If I had this book back then, I would be able to code and understand the Fibonacci sequence without peeking into someone else‚Äôs github repo, maybe it‚Äôs a stretch since I was quite ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù on programming back then. But I surely will be able to understand what a bucket in a hashtable means.</p>
