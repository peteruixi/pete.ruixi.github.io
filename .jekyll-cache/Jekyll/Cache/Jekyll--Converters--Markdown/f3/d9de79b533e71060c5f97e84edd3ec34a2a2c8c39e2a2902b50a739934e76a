<h4 id="myself">Myself</h4>
<p>I was borned in 1998, Guangzhou, China. My father is a middle school history teacher while my mother works for the Enviroment protection agency. Mypartents believed that to speak a foreign laguange is the best pre-school training. Hence, eversince I was four, I would spend my sunday afternoon learning english from foreign instructors all the way till I was fourteen. I am grateful for the decision they made. English and western culture has been an integral part of my life, I grow up watching disney channel Nickalodeans. It made me particularly good at english throughout elemantary school and middle school but not so much anything else. Being able to know you are always better at something than your peers definately is a confidence booster, but at the same time I dont now what I am passionate about other than travelling to a english spearking country.</p>

<p>With the doubt I had, I came to the US for high school hoping to find something I would be interested in. I spent a year and half at a christian high school in San Diego, CA. I would be lying if I said there werenâ€™t any cultural differences. The differences is quite massive, in fact, I had doubts on whether it was the right decision to make. But ultimately, I found what I like, in those days when I dont know how I could fit in, I found my acceptance online, in video games talking to players, streamers online understanding their way of living.</p>
