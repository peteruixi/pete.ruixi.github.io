I"Í	<p>Hi there, to whomever is reading this post. 
Welcome to my site! To find out more about myself, feel free to explore the about tab. It will be filled with a lot more content in the future.</p>

<p>In this post I would like to cover a couple of ‚Äúnew year resolutions‚Äù I have for the year of 2020. For all of the resolutions I planned on mentioning in this blog post, I am determine to achieve majority of them to debunk my impression of people‚Äôs ‚Äúnew year resolutions‚Äù. This is my first time blogging and really substantiate my commitments. I am hoping in this way, I could be more motivated and be more aware of myself.</p>
<h5 id="learn-more-about-computers">Learn more about Computers</h5>
<p>I have just graduated college with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology. One thing I learned in my four years of college is that learning never stops. I‚Äôve been slacking for the past couple of months because of grad school application, family matters, but I am hoping to pick up my thirst for knowledge and momentum of studying once more. Here are the stuff I would do to achieve my goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Posting my novicey analysis on academic paper at least monthly</li>
  <li>Attempting various open source projects</li>
  <li>Sharing my booknotes on online lectures and textbooks</li>
  <li>Summarizing my weekly learning experience at my internship position</li>
</ul>

<p>I would be most likely focusing on computer architecture, machine learning, parallel programming, operating systems and image processing</p>

<p>I wish to become verstaile in more aspects. Hence, I signed up for driver school and will work my way to my driver‚Äôs license finally. And I have also try to spend a minimum of 20mins per day on language learning app and start learning japanese, as I am a big fan of japanese culture.</p>

<p>I longing burden of my is my physical condition. I have always been a large dude. Being a large dude has it‚Äôs fair share of benefits but I would like to change it for the better of my health in the future. Towards the end of my undergrad, I am starting to realize the importance of maintaining one‚Äôs body.</p>

<p>That being said, I would try to not let words and determination go to vain, I will continuously post my journey on this blog, stay tune.</p>
