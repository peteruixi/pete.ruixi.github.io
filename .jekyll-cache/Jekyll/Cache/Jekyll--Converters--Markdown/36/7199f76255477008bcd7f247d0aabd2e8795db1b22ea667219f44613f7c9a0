<p>Hi, my name is Ruixi Li, my friends call me peter or pete. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering this summer from Illinois Institute of Technology. I am currently looking for graduate programs in the states or job offering in the greater souther China area.</p>

<p>My field of interest is in computer architecture, parallel computing and computer security. I will continue to challenge myself to be more creative and productive, even if I donâ€™t find a position where I could receive guidance.  I would still strive for better myself.</p>

<p>Btw, Iâ€™m a chill dude who is into a lot of things: Sports (literally all kinds), Gaming(console &amp; PC), Music of all genres, Film making, Photography, Clothing and Fashion etc. Yea, I like exploring things in this world, I donâ€™t think there is one thing that uninterests me.</p>
